# Projektna-naloga-ROVM
For this project I will be analyzing "The number of achieved points at finale of Eurovision through the years (1975-2019)" for a certain country. The data I will be using I have found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datagraver/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752019). In practise this project will tell us how well a country did a certain year, and which year it got the most points. 
### This project includes
1. Finding appropriate data
2. Analyzing said data according to our needs 
3. Visual presentation of the data in form of a graph
4. Functions that summarise all steps I took to shape the data
5. A video presentation

The youtube link for my video presentation can be found on this link: https://youtu.be/h6WvsxAl8zM . I apologize in advance if the video is too long.
